# Additional Judge-Focused Improvements (Round 2)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. More Nuanced Competitive Claims
- Changed "Only system" to "One of the few" or more specific qualifiers
- Removed absolute claims that could be challenged
- Added "in low-cost systems" qualifiers where appropriate
- Made competitive advantages more specific and defensible

### 2. Added Limitations Section
- **New section on Technology page**: "Limitations & Future Improvements"
- Covers environmental dependencies, output limitations, technical challenges
- Shows maturity and realistic understanding of the solution
- Lists future improvements to show forward-thinking

### 3. Enhanced Validation Transparency
- Added detailed "What's Been Tested vs. What's Projected" section on How It Works page
- Clarified what "prototype tested" means (benchtop vs. field)
- Distinguished between design validation (based on literature) and field validation
- Added validation summary with ✅/🔄/📋 status for each area

### 4. More Precise Technical Claims
- Clarified "prototype tested" means benchtop/lab testing
- Added context about environmental dependencies
- Made it clear that field validation is planned, not complete
- Added notes about variability with conditions

### 5. Enhanced Impact Page
- Added detailed notes about cost comparison assumptions
- Clarified that impact metrics are projections, not validated
- Listed factors that affect actual impact (location, climate, usage)
- Added note about need for field validation

### 6. Strengthened Team Page
- Added "Key Contribution" for each team member
- New "Lessons Learned & Challenges Overcome" section
- Shows learning journey and problem-solving approach
- Demonstrates growth mindset and reflection

### 7. Improved Cost Analysis
- Added more context about cost variability
- Clarified filter replacement needs (6-12 months)
- Made comparison assumptions explicit
- Added notes about regional variations

## What Judges Will Appreciate

1. **Honesty & Transparency**: Clear about limitations, not just benefits
2. **Maturity**: Understanding that field validation is needed
3. **Precision**: Careful language about what's tested vs. projected
4. **Learning Mindset**: Shows reflection and iteration
5. **Realistic Expectations**: Acknowledges environmental dependencies
6. **Defensible Claims**: No absolute statements that can't be backed up

## Key Messages Now Clear

- ✅ Prototype works in benchtop tests
- ✅ Design follows validated methods (SODIS)
- 🔄 Field validation is in progress/planned
- 📋 Long-term studies are planned
- ⚠️ Performance depends on environmental conditions
- ⚠️ Daily output is limited (~1L)
- ⚠️ Best suited for small households, not large families

## Areas of Honest Assessment

1. **Environmental Dependencies**: Clearly stated (humidity, sunlight, temperature)
2. **Output Limitations**: Acknowledged (~1L/day, suitable for 1-2 people)
3. **Technical Challenges**: Surface coating durability, filter maintenance, integration
4. **Future Work Needed**: Field validation, larger capacity, cost optimization

These improvements show the team understands:
- The difference between lab and field performance
- The importance of environmental context
- The need for honest assessment of limitations
- The value of transparency in scientific communication
